# feature-model-benchmarks

This repository contains a set of publicly available feature models and some evaluation results of the [Baital](https://github.com/meelgroup/baital/) tool.  

### Contents
- benchmarks/binary/ contains cnf files in DIMACS format originally appearing in:

- benchmarks/multi-valued/clafer/ contains feature models with features from finite domain (numerical features).  
    1) 7 benchmarks are taken from D. J. Munoz, J. Oh, M. Pinto, L. Fuentes, D. Batory, "Uniform randomsampling product configurations of feature models that have numericalfeatures" in Proceedings of the 23rd International Systems and SoftwareProduct Line Conference-Volume A, 2019  
    2) Remaining benchmarks are taken from B. J. Garvin, M. B. Cohen, and M. B. Dwyer, "An improved meta-heuristic search for constrained interaction testing" in 1st International Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering. IEEE, 13â€“22, 2009. These benchmarks have been transformed into the clafer-like format used by other benchmarks  

- benchmarks/multi-valued/smt/ contains converted benchmarks from benchmarks/multi-valued/clafer into an QF_BV format used by the Baital tool. All these benchmarks have been automatically converted by Baital except for Trimesh.smt   

- baital-results/ contain evaluation results of the Baital tool. Details on each file can be found in baital-results/README.md
